## Description
This application is a card war game. War is a card game that players will receive 1/2 a deck of cards, and play the top card each round. Whoever has the highest card wins the hand, but if the cards are equal in value (rank) there will be a war. In a war, players will each put the 3 cards at the top of their deck into a pile and then flip the next card to see who has the highest ranking card. The player with the higher ranking card will win the hand and the cards. The object of the game is to make the other player run out of cards.
